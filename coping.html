    <h1>Coping with Loss</h1>
    <p>
    The death of a beloved pet is one of the most painful moments a pet owner 
	must face.&nbsp; Whether it comes unexpectedly, or after the course of a 
	long illness, it leaves you with confused and anguished emotions and 
	difficult decisions.&nbsp; The topics below will assist you with some of the 
	emotions and decisions.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>How will I know when it&#39;s time to euthanize my pet?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    Your veterinarian is the best judge of your pet&#39;s physical condition; 
	whether an illness or injury is terminal; whether surgery or medication 
	would significantly prolong your pet&#39;s life and whether the stress and pain 
	involved would be worthwhile; and how long your pet may be expected to live 
	with or without treatment.<br />
	<br />
	You are the best judge of the day to day quality of your pet&#39;s life.&nbsp; 
	You will be able to tell if your pet is suffering unreasonably, or if it is 
	still finding pleasure in life despite its condition.&nbsp; <br />
	<br />
	Evaluate your pet&#39;s health honestly and unselfishly with your veterinarian. 
	Nothing will make this decision an easy one, but it is the final act of love 
	you will make for your pet.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>Should I stay during euthanasia?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    Many pet owners feel this is the ultimate gesture of love and comfort you 
	perform for your pet.&nbsp; Ask yourself honestly whether you are 
	emotionally prepared to handle euthanasia.&nbsp; These emotions are natural, 
	and must be considered for before the decision.&nbsp; Discuss your feelings 
	and options with your veterinarian.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>What do I do now?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    Once your pet has passed away, you face the question of how to handle your 
	beloved pet.&nbsp; When you are upset and grieving, it may seem easiest to 
	leave your pet for disposal with the clinic.&nbsp; Some find this the best 
	choice; others feel they need more.<br />
	<br />
	Home burial is a common choice.&nbsp; This may not be a choice if you rent 
	or plan to move.<br />
	<br />
	A pet cemetery provides a sense of permanence and security and offers a 
	formality and dignity to pet burial.<br />
	<br />
	Cremation is an inexpensive option that allows you to handle your pet&#39;s 
	remains as you wish: bury them, scatter them, or keep them in an urn.<br />
	<br />
	You should consider your living situation, personal and religious values, 
	finances, and plans for the future.&nbsp; It is also best to make 
	arrangements in advance when possible.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>I hurt so much! Do other people feel this way or am I overreacting?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    Intense grief over the loss of a pet is completely normal and natural.&nbsp; 
	Every pet owner considers their pet a beloved friend, companion, and a 
	family member.&nbsp; Others have gone through exactly what you are going 
	through now.&nbsp; You are not being overly sentimental or weak.&nbsp; <br />
	<br />
	You may have spent 10 or more years with your pet.&nbsp; During this time, 
	your pet was a constant part of your life, always ready to give you love, 
	comfort, companionship, and building memories that will last forever.<br />
	<br />
	Your pet has provided you with unconditional and non-judgmental love, a love 
	you will always cherish.&nbsp; Some feel devastated by the ending of such a 
	powerful relationship, however long or brief.&nbsp; Your feelings are valid, 
	and may be extremely painful.&nbsp; You are not alone, others have felt the 
	same and go through these feelings over and over again as they build new 
	loving relationships with new pets.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>What can I expect to feel?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    People experience grief in different ways.&nbsp; Besides sorrow and loss, 
	which may be devastating, you may experience guilt, anger, denial and 
	depression.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>What can I do about these feelings?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    The most important step you take is to be honest with yourself about what 
	you are feeling.&nbsp; Don&#39;t deny that you are feeling pain, guilt or anger.&nbsp; 
	By looking at your feelings and coming to terms with them, you soon will 
	begin to work through your sorrow.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>Who can I talk to?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    It is important to find someone understanding to talk with.&nbsp; If your 
	family or friends love pets, they will understand what you are going 
	through.&nbsp; Do not hide your feelings from them in a misguided attempt to 
	appear strong and calm.&nbsp; If your friends and family do not see your 
	need for comfort, they will not be able to provide the support you need.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>What should I tell my children?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    Honesty is important.&nbsp; Accept your children&#39;s grief as you accept your 
	own.&nbsp; Discuss the loss of your pet with the whole family, giving 
	everyone a chance to work through their emotions and pain together.</p>
	<h6>
    <strong>Why are my other pets acting strangely?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    Just as you react to the loss of a family member, your other pets are bound 
	to notice the absence of their companion and friend.&nbsp; Pets observe 
	every change in the household; the absence of a family member, rearrangement 
	of furniture, or a new object.&nbsp; Certainly they&#39;re going to realize that 
	someone is missing.&nbsp; You may need to give surviving pets extra 
	attention and love to help them through this period.&nbsp; You may also find 
	that this will help you through your own sorrow more quickly than you ever 
	expected. </p>
	<h6>
    <strong>Should I get a new pet right away?</strong></h6>
	<p>
    For most people, the answer is no.&nbsp; Generally, one needs time to work 
	through their grief and loss.&nbsp; Some find bringing in a new pet is 
	comforting.&nbsp; A new pet will never be a replacement, but should be 
	acquired to be loved and accepted for its own qualities.&nbsp; Select a pet 
	you will be able to build another long loving relationship with...because 
	this is what a new pet is all about.<em><br />

	Anderson&#39;s book, &quot;Coping With Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet&quot; is available.</em></p>
