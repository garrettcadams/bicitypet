							Dear Mischa,<br />
							We saw you for adoption on Georgia English Bulldog 
							Rescue and it was love at the first time we saw your 
							picture. December was our best day, because we could 
							welcome in our family with your new 4 legged friend 
							Jonatan. We enjoyed every minute...no...every second 
							with you. You are the sweetest ever. A view month 
							later, we realized, that you are not feeling good. 
							we had to bring you to auburn small animal clinic. 
							They diagnozed cancer. Our world broke down . But we 
							and the Rescue , never gave up on you. After the 
							surgery and chemo therapy, we thought, we will have 
							more time with you. July 6, you had breathing 
							problems and had a stroke with both parts in your 
							brain damaged. You couldn't walk, eat and drink 
							nomore. It was a hard decision to let you go.&nbsp; 
							But love means also letting go in the right moment. 
							Over the rainbow bridge , where you are now, you 
							will have no more pain. You will be loved and 
							touched. We&nbsp; miss you sweetheart. It was a blessing, 
							having you in our live. Now you are gone but never 
							forgotten.<br />
							<span>R.I.P. Our sweet girl Misha.We will never 
							forget you.<br />
							July,11.2012<br />
							<br />
							</span>A 'SPECIAL PLACE' for our loved Misha.R.I.P.<br />
							<br />
							You have a special place Dear Lord<br />
							that I know you'll always keep<br />
							A special place reserved for dogs<br />
							when they quietly fall asleep<br />
							<span>... With large and airy kennels<br />
							and a yard for hiding bones<br />
							With maybe a little babbling creek<br />
							that chatters over stones.<br />
							With wide green fields and flowers<br />
							for those who never knew<br />
							about running freely under<br />
							Your sky of perfect blue.<br />
							Lord,I know You keep this Special Place<br />
							And so to you I Pray,<br />
							For one Special English Bulldog named Misha<br />
							Who quietly died today<br />
							She was full of strength &amp; love<br />
							and so very, very wise.<br />
							The puppy look she once had<br />
							Had long since left her eyes.<br />
							She is dearly missed my Lord<br />
							By a very good friend of mine.<br />
							She went to join her ancestors<br />
							To Your land that is Devine<br />
							So, speak to Misha softly please<br />
							And give her a warm hello.<br />
							She's a Special gift to you Dear Lord<br />
							<br />
							From Susanne, Anthony, De'San, Jonatan and Desteny, 
							who loved her so.<br />

						<img alt="" height="224" src="tyson1%20(2).jpg" style="float: left" width="300" />Tyson 
						"T-Bone"<br />
						<br />
						</strong>My little T boy was suddenly taken from us on 
						March 28, 2012. He was 12 years old, but had the 
						personality and spirit of of a 5 year old. He was the 
						kindest soul I ever knew--even a bit of a pushover!
						<br />
						I frequently had to scare others away from his food so 
						he could actually eat it--otherwise, he would stand 
						there and watch his food disappear. He loved catching 
						birds and mice and leaving us "surprises" on our 
						doorstep. He had many pals around the neighborhood and 
						was always willing to accept a meal if someone happened 
						to offer! He was very good at pretending to be starving 
						and neglected just to get a snack! <br />
						I have had Tyson since he was a 6 wk old kitten and we 
						have been through several new cities and homes together. 
						He always showered me with unconditional love and 
						affection and I cannot imagine not seeing his adorable 
						face everyday. I find myself looking out on the deck 
						waiting for him to begin pawing at the door and am 
						repeatedly saddened when it doesn't happen. This is the 
						toughest loss I have experienced thus far in my life. I 
						can't believe he is gone.<br />
						All I can hope is that Tyson is somewhere better making 
						new friends and infecting others with his kind heart and 
						soul. I will never forget you, T, rest in peace and I 
						love you always.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style6"><em><br />

						<br />
						When I visited the breeder to see her new puppies, I 
						never had any intention of getting one.&nbsp; But in the 
						middle of the melee, you chose me.&nbsp; You were this 
						sweet little ball of fur and you absolutely captured my 
						heart that day. &nbsp;There was something about you that, to 
						this day, I can’t explain, and I knew that you were 
						meant to be mine. &nbsp;I believe you shared every ounce of 
						yourself with our family, every single day.&nbsp; You 
						were always there when I needed to hold you on my lap 
						and snuggle; there were countless times that I needed to 
						smile and you would do something zany and crazy to make 
						me laugh. &nbsp;Even in your last days, you still mustered 
						the strength to give a kiss or two. &nbsp;Despite the moves 
						and the changes in our life, you were the constant 
						unconditional love in my life.&nbsp; I am lost without 
						you right now, my heart is broken, and I miss you more 
						than words could ever say. &nbsp;I will remember you always 
						and even now, despite how much it hurts to say goodbye 
						to you, I smile when I think of you.&nbsp; My life has 
						been changed because you were in it and while I can’t 
						fill the void that you have left in my heart, I know 
						that I am better for having had you in my life.&nbsp; 
						You were my best friend for over 13 years and I thank 
						you, from the bottom of my heart, for everything that 
						you were to me and our family.&nbsp; We will miss you.&nbsp; 
						Tell “Z” we said hi, and we’ll see you again someday.&nbsp; 
						I love you and I miss you so very, very much.&nbsp;

						Sheeba - "Sheebanator"<br />

						<em>My husband met Sheeba at a shelter in Sacramento, CA 
						while he was volunteering there to work through grief 
						from the loss of his previous dog. Sheeba's attentive 
						eyes, intense play, and gentle nature created a 
						connection that healed his heart and started a whole new 
						companionship. He quickly changed her name from "Fatso" 
						to "Sheeba". Her "always on the alert" nature and 
						fearlessness in any situation earned her the nickname 
						"Sheebanator. &nbsp;I met Sheeba seven years ago when I met 
						my husband, and she stole my heart before he did but was 
						happy to share it with her dad. Twelve years, a 
						marriage, a cross country relocation, and so many 
						special moments later, Sheeba suddenly went from her 
						playful, attentive, alert self to a panting, confused, 
						dazed dog that seemed like a just shell of our Sheeba. A 
						day later, we learned that she had a glioma (inoperable 
						tumor) in her forebrain that was responsible for her 
						symptoms. A dose of medication to bring down any 
						swelling would tell us if we could buy any more time 
						with her, and it did not work. Two days later, realizing 
						that the 'real' Sheeba was mostly gone already, and 
						learning that her life would only get worse with 
						seizures, pain, and more confusion, we made the 
						heartbreaking decision to say our goodbyes to her before 
						she suffered further.<br />
						<br />
						Nothing can fill the empty space at our feet, on our 
						walks, on our porch, in the yard, in the car, at the 
						door when we leave and come home...and so many other 
						places. There is no escaping the void left behind 
						because if we were home, Sheeba was by our side. Such a 
						complete and unconditional companionship was taken from 
						us in such a short time, so unexpectedly. Aside from 
						some arthritis, she was a healthy, active, playful dog. 
						We are struggling with the reality of it weeks later, 
						still expecting her sweet face to greet us each time we 
						wake up or return home, and feeling like - surely - she 
						should be waking up from her nap any time now. &nbsp;<br />
						<br />
						They say that loves ones are never truly lost as long as 
						they live on in our memories. &nbsp;Well, Sheeba, our 
						incredible Sheebanator...that means you are by our side 
						as long as we live. You're here with every crackle of a 
						package you thought would be for you, every shake of the 
						keys you hoped meant a car ride, every game day you 
						'suited up for' with us, every grocery trip that 
						included a treat for you, every snowfall that you would 
						so happily 'romp around' in, every barbeque you had to 
						taste test, every neighborhood bark that you would 
						answer, every glance at our 'tug of war' spots around 
						the house, every Halloween that you would have spent 
						greeting the visitors that came 'just for you', every 
						sunny day that lights your favorite corner of the porch, 
						every glass of wine that you - the eternal California 
						doggie - would need one tasting of. &nbsp;We can't reach down 
						and pet you, but we can feel you here in all of the 
						sweet memories we're holding so dear. &nbsp;We miss you more 
						than words can say, Sheebanator, and we'll never stop 
						loving you.&nbsp;<br />

	</span><em>8 years ago you came into our life...tail wagging, ears flopping 
	and balance just a little off. Your liter name was Frank, but your dad and I 
	weren't having that. So with names in mind we decided that once we saw you 
	it would decide what you would be called. Once we held you in our arms with 
	a tight and warm embrace the kisses you gave were amazing and ooooh that 
	lovely puppy breath was such a sweet aroma to our nose. As soon as we saw 
	you run we knew that Titus would be your name, a name in the bible which 
	means "giant and strength" a sure fit for who you would become. A giant you 
	would not be in sight, but who could tell you any different, and strength 
	was right on because that is exactly what you provided through the good, bad 
	and trivial. So into the AKC we submitted your full name so it could be 
	recorded on your family tree, "Sir King Titus" is what it’s going to be. We 
	watched you grow into your body, and become a protector of your house; you 
	melted the hearts of all you met and oh how could we forget that domineering 
	bark. Tonight you were called on to a better place, your heavenly life and 
	the earthly life you knew here is gone.&nbsp; Although you are physically 
	gone, in our hearts you will always and forever live on. Titus I thank you 
	for giving us 8 of the best years of our lives, you were the best first 
	child any parents could ask for and you will be dearly missed.&nbsp; May you 
	rest in peace and I know you were greeted at heaven’s doggy door with a “Job

	socket wrench!! The name was perfect! For 14 short years he has been a loyal 
	friend and always welcomed the many strays that we have adopted into our 
	family. He had such a kind and gentle spirit like no other pet we have ever 
	had. Today, September 9, 2010, he passed away in my arms. He loved his 
	family and his passing has left a void in our hearts and we will miss him 
	terribly. <br />
	God Bless you, Socket! - R.S.<br />

	&quot;This is my Chocolate Lab - Cocoa. She was almost fourteen and she passed 
	away on Monday, July 19. My heart is broken. She was my best friend and 
	companion for fourteen years. There is nothing more special than the 
	unconditional love of a pet. I miss her terribly. I have so many fond 
	memories of her...hopefully that will help me to get through the grieving 
	process.&quot; - C.S.<br />
